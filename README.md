# Otsu-method
The study of image thresholding using the Otsu method. The  OTSU method Algorithm is invented by Nobuyuki Otsu which is used for image binarization of  black and white of two pieces of highly contrasting.


Secondly, this report consists of the study of image thresholding using the Otsu method. The 
OTSU method Algorithm is invented by Nobuyuki Otsu which is used for image binarization of 
black and white of two pieces of highly contrasting. Separating the image pixel intensity of two 
levels which are background and foreground. Using the greater the variance, the lower the 
correlation, the largest variance of grey value pixel intensity is founded that is the binarized 
separator limit which is called the variance maximum threshold value in the image. Then using 
that binarized separator limit, the binary image can be obtained which is introduced as image 
thresholding using OTSU method Algorithm.[s14320_Image scaling and Otsu method Report.pdf](https://github.com/Umeshika97/Otsu-method/files/11240035/s14320_Image.scaling.and.Otsu.method.Report.pdf)
